Kessler is an asynchronous multiplayer client and server package for Kerbal Space Program. By automatically merging save files, it allows for a shared world: anything one player launches will appear in the save files of every player connected to the server. At the moment, it features:

 * Automatic synchronization and merging of save file contents
 * Limited duplicate detection
 * Ability to filter save contents on the client *and* server, for example, to exclude debris or NaN-affected objects

At present, only the first version of a flight uploaded to the server is stored, and later changes made to it by players will not be uploaded; a feature is under development that would permit later changes to a flight to be copied to all of the clients, allowing not just shared game worlds, but shared flights.

The client and server also come with a save file editor, allowing you to:

 * Combine save files
 * Teleport objects to any orbit
 * Make detached stages controllable
 * Delete objects
 * Edit raw object properties such as orbital characteristics and staging information



To install Kessler, download KSPKessler.zip and unpack it your KSP directory. You should end up with a "kessler" directory and three batch files, "kessler_server", "kessler_client", and "kessler_editor".

In addition to Kessler itself, you will need Java installed.

To host a server, edit kessler/server_config.txt and then run kessler_server.bat.

To join a game, edit kessler/client_config.txt (make sure the host, port, and password you enter match the ones the server is using) and run kessler_client.bat. You can run it any time as long as you aren't actually looking at the world - so, at the VAB or KSC is safe, in-flight or at the tracking centre is not.

To edit your save file, run kessler_editor.bat. Type 'help' at the prompt to get a list of commands, and 'help <command>' for help on a specific command.

OSX/Linux users: you should be able to run the jar directly, or from the terminal in your KSP directory with:

  java -cp kessler -jar kessler/server.jar   # for the server
  java -cp kessler -jar kessler/client.jar   # for the client
  java -cp kessler -jar kessler/sfsedit.jar  # for the editor
