# Whether or not to permit debris or not. Debris is interesting (and thematic!) but can bog down
# the game on slower systems; furthermore, there is as yet no perfectly reliable way to detect
# duplicate debris when each duplicate was created by a different player, so under some circumstances
# you can end up with duplicates of the same debris (albeit not in the same place), or debris in
# space that's a duplicate of stages still attached to a ship in your game.
#
# There are four possible values for this option:
#   all                 allow all debris
#   only_controllable   only allow controllable objects (reject any non-controllable debris)
#   only_named          only allow objects with names that don't end in "Debris"
#   none                reject all debris (allow only pilotable objects with names that don't end in "Debris")
# If unspecified, the default is "all".
#
# Regardless of this setting, debris you create yourself will be left as-is; it only affects whether
# debris from other players will be downloaded by Kessler.
