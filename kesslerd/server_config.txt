#       launchpad       anything on the KSC launchpad
#       ksc             anything on the KSC grounds but not on the launchpad itself
#       nan             anything with NaN errors in it

# The recommended value is to filter out ships with NaN errors (causes massive performance hits),
# ghost ships (clutter up the map screen with orbits with no ship attached), and ships on the
# launchpad (or clients will get a "X is already on the launchpad!" warning every time they sync).
